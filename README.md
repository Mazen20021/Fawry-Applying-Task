## 🛠 Technology Stack

### 🔹 Frontend – Flutter
- I chose Flutter for its rapid development capabilities, which aligned well with the project's time constraints. Given the limited time available, I was unable to study React in depth.
- Built with **Flutter** for a modern, fast, and cross-platform user experience.
- Utilizes **Cubit (Bloc Pattern)** for efficient state management.
- Supports dynamic API calls to fetch and display movie data interactively.

### 🔹 Backend – Spring Boot
- Developed using **Spring Boot (Java 23)** for a scalable and high-performance backend.
- Fetches movie data from the **OMDb API**.
- Integrates with **Firebase** for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### 🔹 Database – Firebase
- Utilized as a cloud-based **NoSQL database**.
- Stores movie search results to reduce API calls and enhance performance.
- Chosen to enable public access and real-time data synchronization
